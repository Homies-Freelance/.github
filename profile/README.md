## Private Operations

This organization serves as the primary development and management hub for our team's private client engagements.

- **Confidentiality:** Repositories within this organization are private by default to protect client Intellectual Property (IP) and sensitive data.
- **Collaboration:** Access is restricted to authorized team members and the specific client associated with the project.
- **Focus:** Full-stack development, AI integration, and scalable system architecture.

## For Clients

If you are currently working with us, here is how we manage your code:

1.  **Repo Creation:** Upon order initiation, we create a private repository dedicated to your project.
2.  **Access:** You will receive an invite to join as an **Outside Collaborator** (maintaining your visibility on progress).
3.  **Ownership Transfer:** Upon project completion and final delivery, we offer to transfer full repository ownership to your personal or organization account.

## Join the Core Team

Are you a developer looking for a meritocratic environment? We are scaling our operations and looking for contributors.

- **The Model:** We utilize a **Weighted Contribution Model**. Profits are distributed based on code complexity, review quality, and net effective contribution—not just hours logged.
- **The Stack:** We need proficiency in `React`, `Node.js`, `Python`, or `DevOps`.
- **The Workflow:** Async, Git-heavy, and high autonomy.
